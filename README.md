## How To Use

To clone and run this template, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash

# Go into the repository
$ cd neuralift

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start the local development server (on port 8080)
$ npm start

# Ready for production?
# Build the production ready code to the /dist folder
$ npm run build

# Play your production ready game in the browser
$ npm run serve
```

Change the **gameName** in /webpack/webpack.common.js.

All your game code lies inside the **/src/scripts** folder. All assets need to be inside the **/src/assets** folder in order to get copied to /dist while creating the production build. Do not change the name of the index.html and game.ts files.

    })
  }
</script>
```
